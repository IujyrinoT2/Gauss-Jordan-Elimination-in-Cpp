# Gauss Jordan Elimination in C++ 
 Solves any linear equation system, showing every step taken.  

To load a linear system you have to modify "System data.txt". All the numbers have to be separated by space. 

   
4                   <=== Number of equations
3                   <=== Number of unknown solution  (x1, x2, ...)

2 5 -8              //  Matrix of solution coeficients 
4 3 -9              //
2 3 -5              //
1 8 -7              //

8 9 7 12            // Vector of equation results
